## Threat Hunting

### TaHiTI (Targeted Hunting integrating Threat Intelligence)

The TaHiTI methodology for threat hunting is created with real hunting practice in mind and provides organization with a standardized and repeatable approach to their hunting investigations. The methodology uses 3 phases and 6 steps and integrates threat intelligence throughout its execution. These 3 phases are “initialize” (process input), “hunt” (the execution phase) and “finalize” (process output). Organizations can use the TaHiTI methodology to connect the threat hunting process to other processes, especially the threat intelligence process. TaHiTI is based on practical experience and aggregates existing resources into a single comprehensible methodology.

TaHiTI is supported by the "MaGMa for threat hunting tool", which can be used to provide insight into the results of the process and guidance for improvement. Organizations already using the MaGMa use case framework will be able to easily integrate the threat hunting and security monitoring processes.
