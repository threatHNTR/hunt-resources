**MaGMa (Management, Growth and Metrics & assessment)**

The MaGMa Use Case Framework (UCF) is a framework and tool for use case management and administration that helps organizations to operationalize their security monitoring strategy. MaGMa stands for Management, Growth, Metrics & assessment. These are the pillars of the framework that help to guide the use case management process. The MaGMa framework covers everything from the creation of new use cases to maintenance of use cases, growing and maturing existing use case, and embedding use case management in a continuous improvement approach. The MaGMa UCF provides the capability to be in control over your security monitoring process and the alignment of security monitoring to business and compliance needs.
